# Installing Python

You can download Python for Windows at [python.org](http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/).

Just run the installer and it will install it on your system.

# Installing Google App Engine

You can downlaod Google App Engine from [developers.google.com/appengine](http://googleappengine.googlecode.com/files/GoogleAppEngine-1.7.5.msi)

Same thing here, just run the installer, the default settings are fine.

# Creating A New App

Run the installer, go to file->Create New Application then pick a name and a directory.  It will create a folder with
default files with the name of the application.

# Starting Files

I created a file with some helper functions that makes things easier.  It is the file called main_starter.py.  You can replace
main.py with this file, just rename it main.py.

# Download
