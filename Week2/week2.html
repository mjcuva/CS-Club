			<div>The entity was none other than Jeff Goldblum.</div>
			<div>With his near-infinite wisdom and acting ability, Jeff Goldblum dramatically clapped his hands.  The force of teh clap was so great that it caused a massive explosion that gave birth to teh universe, an event now known as the big bang.</div>
			<div>After watching the universe for billions of years, Jeff Goldblum grew bored of being the only living thing in existnace, so he invented his greated creation of all, DNA.</div>
			<div>He placed this DNA on a single planet in a single solar system in a single galaxy, and then watched it evolve.  Over time, the DNA evolved into a huge variety of creatures, including the human, which was Jeff Goldblum's favorite creature.</div>
			<div>Eventually, the humans created teh movie industry, which interested Jeff Goldblum so much that he created a human body for himself so he could become an actor.</div>
			<br>
			<div>And that is the story of Jeff Goldblum.</div>
